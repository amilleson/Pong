# Pong

My take on the classic pong game.

What I am most proud of is giving the ball the properties that the original pong ball had, such as making it bounce off the paddles
once hit, scoring the point and returning, and all of the intracacies associated with that. That was also the biggest challenge of the 
project, making all of the algorithms for the ball work when how it was supposed to.
